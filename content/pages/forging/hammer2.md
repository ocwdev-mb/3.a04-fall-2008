This cross-peen hammer has a round face at one end, to spread evenly in all directions, and a blunt wedge (peen) on the other, to lengthen the metal in one dimension only. The straight-peen is similar, but the wedge is parallel to the handle, rather than perpendicular. This hammer has two different peen widths on its head, to confine the impact to a smaller or larger area as needed. This ball-peen hammer has a flat face and a hemispherical peen, to allow simultaneous isotropic spreading in the plane and curving up out of the plane.
