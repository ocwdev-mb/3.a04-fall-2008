Many accessories have developed to make blacksmithing easier and safer. All students are required to wear safety goggles, closed-toed shoes, and have no dangling clothing or hair. Tongs and/or leather gloves help grip small workpieces. To put twists in square or bar stock, heat the piece in the area to be twisted, then brace it in a press. Apply the S-curve above the heated area and twist evenly but quickly. Stop when the metal is noticeably cooled.
