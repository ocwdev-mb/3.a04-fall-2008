After drawing a taper, bending it into a corner or scroll is a common next step. Here, the edge of the anvil is used to put a start the bend. After another heat, the piece is hammered back onto itself. If the end needs to be tucked in tightly, the edge of the anvil can be used as a fulcrum. If not, the edge can be used to put a series of sharp bends in the metal. After the spiral has started, it can be rolled up as far as desired.
