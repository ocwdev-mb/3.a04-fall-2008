Widen the hole using the horn of the anvil, a small hardy horn, or a succession of larger drifts, until is is roughly the size of a bottlecap. It should have a roughly round cross-section. While hammering using the horn, the majority of your blows should be around the circumference of the piece, not on the faces. You do not want your piece to become thin and weak during this operation. Only hammer on the faces to correct unwanted distortion created by hammering on the horn.
