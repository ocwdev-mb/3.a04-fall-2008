Form the tab for lifting the cap using a blunt punch, pushing the metal towards the hole. Test the result on a bottle to see if anything needs altering or neatening up at this point. Cut the workpiece off the stock, leaving 4-6" after the neck as a handle. A hardy or hacksaw can be used. Tidy up the corners and faces, as needed. Crack open a cold soda and enjoy! The finished bottle opener.
