This piece needs to be clamped aggressively, so it doesn't move while veins are incised with a cold chisel. On the other end of the bar, a tight scroll is formed. Re-working metal too much runs the risk of weakening or melting it. Fire management is especially important when working with small, thin sections of metal.
