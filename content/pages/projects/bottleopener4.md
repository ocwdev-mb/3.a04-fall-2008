This student punched a hole too far from the end of the piece, and decided it would be easier to remove the extra metal than even it out. Using a sharp punch, a curved cut is started and then reinscribed until the cut is complete. Note the use of a bronze plate to preserve the anvil face and punch tip from damage. Leaving the piece in the fire too long or at too high a temperature can melt the metal, deforming the shape and weakening the structure. Here, the student successfully salvaged the opener.
