Start rounding off the corners at the end, by hammering on them at a 45Â° angle. Use a punch to begin to create a hole in the center of the bottle opener head. Continue to heat and punch until you are approximately 3/4ths of the way through, then flip the stock over and punch through the other side. When you are close to punching through the material, place the piece over the pritchel hole. This way, when you do punch through, the punch will not damage the anvil face or shatter. Continue to use the punch as a drift to open up the hole, until it is big enough to fit on the horn. Hammer the drift into the material over the pritchel or hardy hole. Flip sides every heat to prevent unwanted distortions. Extra hands may be needed to hold the punch steady while hammering. A hardy horn can be used to open the hole, as an intermediate step between the drift and the anvil horn.
