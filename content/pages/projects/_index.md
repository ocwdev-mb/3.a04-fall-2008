The first student project assignment was to make a bottle opener. Start with a piece of bar stock 1/4"x1", and put a notch in it 1.5" from the end. This will become the neck between the handle and the opener. Use a spring fuller to neck the material at that point down to 0.5" wide. Hammer a taper into what will be the handle of your bottle opener, up to the area that was just fullered.
