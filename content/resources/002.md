description: Take care not to smother the flames, and/or make sure the airflow is
  sufficient. As the coal heats up, it will start to offgas. The exhaust should be
  taken up by the hood, not released into the room, as it contains sulfur dioxide
  and other hazardous materials. Too much airflow tends to blow the fumes away from
  the exhaust and into the room.
